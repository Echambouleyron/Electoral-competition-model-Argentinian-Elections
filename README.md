# Electoral-competition-model-Argentinian-Elections

This project aims to determine how was vote transfered from the 2019 PASO (argentinian primaries for President) election to the general election that took place two months afterwards. In other words, this model tries to asses how voters that casted their votes in the PASO election, behaved later on in the general election. Therefore, the results portrayed in this project can give insights on the ability of each party to retain/alienate votes from one election to another one. 


## How?

To determine vote transfer a multivariate linear regression model is used, where the independent variables are the percentages obtained by each party in each voting table across the entire country in the PASO election, whereas the dependent variables are the percentages obtained by each party in the general election in each voting table across the entire country. 
The package used is statsmodel.api runned in python.
